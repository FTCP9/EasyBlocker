 - after that you will add your ips from connections.txt or blacklsit.txt from sonar to the ipset using this commands:
  - For kokot.go: ```while IFS= read -r ip; do     sudo ipset add blocked_ips "$ip"; done < "connections.txt"```
  - For Sonar.jar: ```while IFS= read -r ip; do     sudo ipset add blocked_ips "$ip"; done < "yourblacklist.txt"```
 - After you are done adding this into the ipset you need to drop the ips from ipset using this iptables command: ```sudo iptables -A INPUT -m set --match-set blocked_ips src -j DROP```
